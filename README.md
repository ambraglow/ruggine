## Ruggine
This is a Rust project i'm working on partly to learn the language,
partly to learn about the maths behind dsp to use the experience towards working on my own SDR software.

## What i've worked on so far:

- Implemented graphing functions using the (plotter)[https://github.com/plotter-rs/plotter] crate, to use with time and frequency graphs.
- Simple DFT (i have to implement the cooley tukey algo still :sob:)

^p.s ruggine just means rust in Italian
